# endless-halls

Endless Halls was the Final project for my Computer Science II class, Spring 2018.

The concept is based off of a hidden maze within World of Warcraft in which a player can only see one room at a time and has to
find colored orbs and bring them to the matching color altar room before winning.

The "real" Warcraft map is randomly generated - something I wanted to do, but knew would be more complex than I would
have time for.

There are two difficulties: 
  - Easy: Mainly for testing to make sure all the requirements and room types worked. Also helps players know what to do :)
  - Hard: Based on another players rendition of a Warcraft map. The solution is in the PDF File.
